1. Connect Google Workspace with Custom Domain

- Now, a Getting Started page will show (Ref. Getting_Started.jpg)
- Google will ask to verify the domain.  Click on “Protect”. Click on “Sign in to Verify”.  Google will provide a TXT record to add to your domain’s DNS settings.
- Sign in to the registrar.  It will automatically input the TXT record that needs to be inserted on the registrar website.
- Click on “Authorize” to connect with the domain.
- Wait for about 5 minutes while Google verifies and connects the domain to Google Workspace.
- In case this doesn’t work, this is what will need to be done.
	a. Log into your domain registrar’s website and add the TXT record as instructed.
	b. Once added, return to the Google Workspace setup and click “Verify".

2. Add Users (Optional)

- Next it will ask to create users.
- Click on “Create”. 
- Enter the user’s name, username, and follow the prompts to create their account.
- Create as many users as need to be created.
- Click on “Continue”

3. Activate Email Accounts

- Now it’s time to set up the email accounts.
- Click on Activate on the Getting Started Menu (Ref. Activate_Gmail.jpg)
- Click on “I’m Ready to Activate Gmail”.
- Click on “Sign in to Activate”
- Sign in to the registrar.  It will automatically input the MX record that needs to be inserted on the registrar website.
- Click on “Authorize” to connect with the domain.
- Wait for about 5 minutes while Google verifies and connects the domain to Google Workspace.
- Once the email is connected to the domain. Congratulations! Google Workspace account is set up.
