Changing Primary Domains


Summary: This document explains how to change your primary domain.  To do this, you will need to have purchased that additional domain.


1. Add and Verify Secondary Domain

- Login as admin on Google Workspace account.
- Go to the Accounts tab on the right → Domains → Manage Domains
- Click on “Add a Domain”
- Make sure “Secondary Domain” is chosen. Type the new Domain name.
- Go through the process of Google verifying the domain by adding the TXT records and activating the Gmail accounts just like how it was done for the first domain.


2. Update Users and Add New Domain

- From the Google Admin page, go to Directory → Users
- Click on the user that needs their email switched. 
- Click on “Update User”.  Change the email from the drop-down to the new domain name. This will change the user’s alternate email to what was the old domain name.
- Change every user’s primary account to the new email address.  
-  Sent a test email to new domain from a different email. 


3. Change Group Email Primary Domain

- Now the email address of groups will have to be changed.
- Go to the Groups tab under the Directory menu.
- Click on the Group name.
- Under Group Information, click on the Down arrow (Ref. Group_Information.jpg)
- Edit it and change the domain to match the new domain name.


4. Changing the Primary Domain

- Now it is time to change the secondary domain into the primary domain.
- From the Admin homepage, click on Account → Domains → Manage Domains.
- Click “Deactivate” where it says Test domain alias (Ref. Deactivate_Test_Alias.jpg)
- Click on “Change Primary Domain”
- Click on “Continue”. Type in the name of the domain that you want to switch to.
- Click “Change Primary Domain”
- It will take time for the primary domain to change.  
- When done, reactivate the test domain alias.


5.  Erase Alternative Email and Erase Old Domain (Optional)

Note: Follow these steps if you intend to delete the old Domain. If you want to keep the secondary domain separate, then skip this.
- Go to “Add Alternate Emails”
- Delete the old account by clicking on the “X” (Ref. Erase_Alternate_Email)
- Click “Save”
- Go to every other user and do the same thing.
- Under Admin Console, go to Account → Domains → Manage Domains.
- Click on “Remove” and the domain will be removed (make sure test domain alias is deactivated or the domain won’t delete)


6. Make sure new domain works

- Send a test email FROM new domain to one of your emails to make sure it sends emails.
- If the email is received.  From another account, send the new domain an email.
- If the email is received on the new domain, then everything is set up.
